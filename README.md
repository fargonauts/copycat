co.py.cat
=========

An implementation of the [Douglas Hofstadter](http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/)'s [copycat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycat_%28software%29) algorithm

This implementation is a copycat of Scott Boland's [Java implementation](http://itee.uq.edu.au/~scottb/_Copycat/), but re-written into Python. It's not a direct translation - but based on his code. I did not carry over the GUI, as this version can more usefully be run from command line, or imported for use by other Python scripts.

In cases where I could not grok the Java implementation easily or directly I took ideas from the [LISP implementation](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mm/how-to-get-copycat.html), or directly from [Melanie Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanie_Mitchell)'s "[Analogy-Making as Perception](http://www.amazon.com/Analogy-Making-Perception-Computer-Melanie-Mitchell/dp/0262132893/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1351269085&sr=1-3)"
