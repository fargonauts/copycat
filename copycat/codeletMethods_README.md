# Codelet Methods

## Overview
The codelet methods system is a core component of the Copycat architecture that implements the various operations and behaviors that codelets can perform. This system defines the actual implementation of codelet behaviors that drive the analogical reasoning process.

## Key Components
- Codelet operation implementations
- Behavior definitions
- Action handlers
- State management
- Event processing

## Codelet Types
1. **Workspace Codelets**
   - Object creation and modification
   - Structure building
   - Relationship formation
   - Group management

2. **Slipnet Codelets**
   - Concept activation
   - Node management
   - Link formation
   - Activation spreading

3. **Correspondence Codelets**
   - Mapping creation
   - Relationship matching
   - Structure alignment
   - Similarity assessment

## Usage
Codelet methods are called by the coderack system when codelets are executed:

```python
# Example of a codelet method implementation
def some_codelet_method(workspace, slipnet, coderack):
    # Perform operations
    # Update state
    # Create new codelets
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies required

## Related Components
- Coderack: Manages codelet execution
- Workspace: Provides objects to operate on
- Slipnet: Provides conceptual knowledge
- Correspondence: Manages mappings between structures
