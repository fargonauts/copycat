# Concept Mapping System

## Overview
The concept mapping system is a crucial component of the Copycat architecture that manages the mapping between concepts and their representations in the workspace. This system handles the translation between abstract concepts and concrete instances.

## Key Features
- Concept-to-instance mapping
- Mapping validation
- Relationship tracking
- State management
- Event handling

## Mapping Types
1. **Direct Mappings**
   - Letter-to-concept mappings
   - Number-to-concept mappings
   - Symbol-to-concept mappings
   - Pattern-to-concept mappings

2. **Structural Mappings**
   - Group-to-concept mappings
   - Bond-to-concept mappings
   - Hierarchy-to-concept mappings
   - Pattern-to-concept mappings

3. **Special Mappings**
   - Rule-to-concept mappings
   - Context-to-concept mappings
   - Meta-concept mappings
   - Derived mappings

## Usage
Concept mappings are created and managed through the mapping system:

```python
# Create a new concept mapping
mapping = ConceptMapping(source, target)

# Access mapping properties
strength = mapping.get_strength()

# Modify mapping state
mapping.set_strength(new_value)
```
