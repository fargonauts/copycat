# Description System

## Overview
The description system is a core component of the Copycat architecture that manages the representation and generation of descriptions for objects and structures in the workspace. This system provides detailed characterizations of elements in the analogical reasoning process.

## Key Features
- Object description
- Structure characterization
- Property management
- Relationship description
- State representation

## Description Types
1. **Basic Descriptions**
   - Object properties
   - Structure features
   - Relationship details
   - State information

2. **Composite Descriptions**
   - Group characteristics
   - Pattern descriptions
   - Hierarchical details
   - Context information

3. **Special Descriptions**
   - Rule descriptions
   - Mapping details
   - Meta-descriptions
   - Derived characteristics

## Usage
Descriptions are created and managed through the description system:

```python
# Create a description
desc = Description(object)

# Add properties
desc.add_property('property_name', value)

# Generate description
text = desc.generate()
```
