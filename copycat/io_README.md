# Input/Output System

## Overview
The input/output system is a utility component of the Copycat architecture that handles file and data input/output operations. This system provides interfaces for reading and writing data to and from various sources.

## Key Features
- File operations
- Data parsing
- Format conversion
- Error handling
- State management

## Operation Types
1. **File Operations**
   - File reading
   - File writing
   - File management
   - Path handling

2. **Data Operations**
   - Data parsing
   - Format conversion
   - Data validation
   - Error handling

3. **Special Operations**
   - Configuration loading
   - Logging
   - Debug output
   - State persistence

## Usage
I/O operations are performed through the I/O system:

```python
# Read from a file
data = io.read_file(file_path)

# Write to a file
io.write_file(file_path, data)

# Parse data
parsed = io.parse_data(data)
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies required
