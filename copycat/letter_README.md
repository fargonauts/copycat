# Letter System

## Overview
The letter system is a specialized component of the Copycat architecture that handles the representation and manipulation of individual letters and characters in the workspace. This system manages the properties and behaviors of letter objects in the analogical reasoning process.

## Key Features
- Letter representation
- Character properties
- Letter manipulation
- Pattern matching
- State management

## Letter Types
1. **Basic Letters**
   - Alphabetic characters
   - Numeric characters
   - Special characters
   - Whitespace

2. **Structured Letters**
   - Grouped letters
   - Bonded letters
   - Hierarchical letters
   - Pattern letters

3. **Special Letters**
   - Rule letters
   - Mapping letters
   - Context letters
   - Meta-letters

## Usage
Letter operations are performed through the letter system:

```python
# Create a letter
letter = Letter(char, properties)

# Access letter properties
char = letter.get_char()

# Modify letter state
letter.set_properties(new_properties)
```

## Dependencies
