# Problem System

## Overview
The problem system is a core component of the Copycat architecture that manages the representation and handling of analogical reasoning problems. This system defines the structure and properties of problems that the system attempts to solve.

## Key Features
- Problem representation
- Problem loading
- Problem validation
- Solution tracking
- State management

## Problem Types
1. **Basic Problems**
   - String problems
   - Pattern problems
   - Rule problems
   - Mapping problems

2. **Composite Problems**
   - Multi-step problems
   - Hierarchical problems
   - Network problems
   - Context problems

3. **Special Problems**
   - Test problems
   - Debug problems
   - Meta-problems
   - Derived problems

## Usage
Problems are created and managed through the problem system:

```python
# Create a problem
problem = Problem(initial_state, target_state)

# Load a problem
problem = Problem.load_from_file(file_path)

# Solve a problem
solution = problem.solve()
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies required
