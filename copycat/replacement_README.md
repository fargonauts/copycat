# Replacement System

## Overview
The replacement system is a utility component of the Copycat architecture that manages the substitution and replacement of objects and structures in the workspace. This system handles the transformation of elements during the analogical reasoning process.

## Key Features
- Object replacement
- Structure transformation
- Pattern substitution
- State management
- History tracking

## Operation Types
1. **Basic Operations**
   - Element replacement
   - Pattern substitution
   - Structure transformation
   - State updates

2. **Advanced Operations**
   - Chain replacements
   - Group transformations
   - Context updates
   - History tracking

3. **Special Operations**
   - Rule application
   - Mapping translation
   - Meta-replacements
   - Derived transformations

## Usage
Replacements are performed through the replacement system:

```python
# Replace an object
new_obj = replacement.replace(old_obj, new_obj)

# Apply a transformation
result = replacement.transform(obj, rule)

# Track changes
history = replacement.get_history()
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies required

- Workspace: Contains objects to replace
- Rule: Provides replacement rules
- Correspondence: Maps replacements
- Codelets: Execute replacements
