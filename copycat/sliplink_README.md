# Sliplink System

## Overview
The sliplink system is a core component of the Copycat architecture that manages the connections between nodes in the slipnet. This system handles the creation, modification, and traversal of links between conceptual nodes in the network.

## Key Features
- Link representation
- Connection management
- Weight handling
- State tracking
- Event processing

## Link Types
1. **Basic Links**
   - Category links
   - Property links
   - Instance links
   - Similarity links

2. **Structural Links**
   - Hierarchy links
   - Composition links
   - Association links
   - Pattern links

3. **Special Links**
   - Rule links
   - Context links
   - Meta-links
   - Derived links

## Usage
Sliplinks are created and managed through the sliplink system:

```python
# Create a sliplink
link = Sliplink(source_node, target_node, weight)

# Access link properties
weight = link.get_weight()

# Modify link state
link.set_weight(new_weight)
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies required
