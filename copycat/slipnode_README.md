# Slipnode System

## Overview
The slipnode system is a fundamental component of the Copycat architecture that implements the nodes in the slipnet. Slipnodes represent concepts and their relationships in the conceptual network, forming the basis for analogical reasoning.

## Key Features
- Concept representation
- Activation management
- Link formation
- State tracking
- Event handling

## Node Types
1. **Concept Nodes**
   - Letter concepts
   - Number concepts
   - Relationship concepts
   - Category concepts

2. **Structural Nodes**
   - Group concepts
   - Bond concepts
   - Hierarchy concepts
   - Pattern concepts

3. **Special Nodes**
   - Rule nodes
   - Mapping nodes
   - Context nodes
   - Meta-concept nodes

## Usage
Slipnodes are created and managed through the slipnet system:

```python
# Create a new slipnode
node = Slipnode(name, initial_activation)

# Access node properties
activation = node.get_activation()

# Modify node state
node.set_activation(new_value)
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies required

- Slipnet: Main container for slipnodes
- Sliplinks: Connect slipnodes
- Codelets: Operate on slipnodes
- Workspace: Provides context for node activation
