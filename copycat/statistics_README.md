# Statistics System

## Overview
The statistics system is a utility component of the Copycat architecture that collects and analyzes various metrics and statistics about the system's operation. This system helps in understanding and debugging the analogical reasoning process.

## Key Features
- Performance metrics collection
- Statistical analysis
- Data aggregation
- Reporting utilities
- Debugging support

## Metric Types
1. **Performance Metrics**
   - Codelet execution counts
   - Activation levels
   - Mapping strengths
   - Processing times

2. **System Metrics**
   - Memory usage
   - Object counts
   - Link counts
   - State changes

3. **Analysis Metrics**
   - Success rates
   - Error rates
   - Pattern frequencies
   - Relationship distributions

## Usage
Statistics are collected and analyzed through the statistics system:

```python
# Record a statistic
statistics.record_metric('metric_name', value)

# Get statistical analysis
analysis = statistics.analyze_metric('metric_name')

# Generate report
report = statistics.generate_report()
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies required
