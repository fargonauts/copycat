# Workspace Formulas System

## Overview
The workspace formulas system is a utility component of the Copycat architecture that provides mathematical and logical formulas for workspace operations. This system implements various calculations and transformations used in the analogical reasoning process.

## Key Features
- Mathematical formulas
- Logical operations
- Transformation rules
- Calculation utilities
- State management

## Formula Types
1. **Mathematical Formulas**
   - Distance calculations
   - Similarity measures
   - Probability computations
   - Activation formulas

2. **Logical Formulas**
   - Boolean operations
   - Condition evaluations
   - Rule applications
   - Constraint checks

3. **Transformation Formulas**
   - Object transformations
   - State transitions
   - Value mappings
   - Structure modifications

## Usage
Formulas are used throughout the workspace system:

```python
# Apply a formula
result = workspace_formulas.calculate_distance(obj1, obj2)

# Evaluate a condition
is_valid = workspace_formulas.check_condition(condition)

# Transform an object
transformed = workspace_formulas.apply_transformation(obj)
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies required
