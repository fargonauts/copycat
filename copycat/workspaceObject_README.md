# Workspace Object System

## Overview
The workspace object system is a fundamental component of the Copycat architecture that manages the representation and manipulation of objects in the workspace. The system consists of several related files:

- `workspaceObject.py`: Core implementation of workspace objects
- `workspaceString.py`: String-specific object implementations
- `workspaceStructure.py`: Structural object implementations
- `workspaceFormulas.py`: Formula and calculation utilities

## Workspace Objects
Workspace objects are the basic building blocks of the workspace, representing:
- Letters and characters
- Groups and collections
- Bonds and relationships
- Structural elements

## Key Features
- Object hierarchy and inheritance
- Property management and access
- Relationship tracking
- State management
- Event handling

## Object Types
1. **Basic Objects**
   - Letters and characters
   - Numbers and symbols
   - Special markers

2. **Structural Objects**
   - Groups and collections
   - Bonds and connections
   - Hierarchical structures

3. **Composite Objects**
   - Formulas and expressions
   - Complex relationships
   - Derived objects

## Usage
Workspace objects are created and managed through the workspace system:

```python
# Create a new workspace object
obj = WorkspaceObject(properties)

# Access object properties
value = obj.get_property('property_name')

# Modify object state
obj.set_property('property_name', new_value)
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies required
