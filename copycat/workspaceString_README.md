# Workspace String System

## Overview
The workspace string system is a specialized component of the Copycat architecture that handles string representations and operations in the workspace. This system manages the manipulation and analysis of string-based objects in the analogical reasoning process.

## Key Features
- String representation
- String manipulation
- Pattern matching
- String analysis
- State management

## String Types
1. **Basic Strings**
   - Character sequences
   - Word strings
   - Symbol strings
   - Special markers

2. **Structured Strings**
   - Grouped strings
   - Bonded strings
   - Hierarchical strings
   - Pattern strings

3. **Special Strings**
   - Rule strings
   - Mapping strings
   - Context strings
   - Meta-strings

## Usage
String operations are performed through the workspace string system:

```python
# Create a workspace string
string = WorkspaceString(content)

# Access string properties
length = string.get_length()

# Modify string state
string.set_content(new_content)
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies required
