# Workspace Structure System

## Overview
The workspace structure system is a fundamental component of the Copycat architecture that manages the structural organization of objects in the workspace. This system handles the creation and management of hierarchical and relational structures that form the basis of analogical reasoning.

## Key Features
- Structure representation
- Hierarchy management
- Relationship tracking
- Pattern recognition
- State management

## Structure Types
1. **Basic Structures**
   - Linear sequences
   - Hierarchical trees
   - Network graphs
   - Pattern structures

2. **Composite Structures**
   - Group structures
   - Bond structures
   - Rule structures
   - Mapping structures

3. **Special Structures**
   - Context structures
   - Meta-structures
   - Derived structures
   - Temporary structures

## Usage
Structures are created and managed through the workspace structure system:

```python
# Create a new structure
structure = WorkspaceStructure(type, properties)

# Access structure properties
children = structure.get_children()

# Modify structure state
structure.add_child(child)
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies required
